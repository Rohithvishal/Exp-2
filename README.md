# SRS (Procedure):
**Actors Used-:**

 Librarian
 Student
 Admin
 Software - StarUML

# List of Diagrams -:

 Class Diagram
 Usecase Diagram
 Package Diagram

 Sequence Diagram
 Procedure-:

 Define System Requirements: Outline the functional and non-functional requirements, such as user authentication and transaction processing.
 Identify Key Actors and Use Cases: Determine actors and define their interactions.
 Design the System Architecture: Break down the system into components
 Create UML Diagrams: Develop use case, class, sequence, and activity diagrams based on the system design.
 Test and Validate: Perform testing to ensure the system meets functional requirements and security standards.
